Algorithm Description
===============
* Our core algorithm is a modification of the Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm - MCTS with Progressive History. Progressive History addresses the problem that it may take some time to gather enough information to determine a reliable value for a node. Progressive History is a combination of Progressive Bias and the history heuristic. Progressive Bias requires heuristic knowledge. The Progressive Bias part in Progressive History uses W/(n_i − v_i + 1) to bias the history heuristic part pv_i/pn_i.
pv_i is the summed value of move i for every time i has been played, and pn_i is the total number of times move i has been played. The child k of node p that satisfies is selected for expansion (I is the set of the children of p), whereas ϕ is the Progressive History part:

k ∈ argmax{i∈I}(s_i + C ·√((ln n_p)/n_i)+ ϕ)	...(1)
ϕ = (pv_i/pn_i)* W/(n_i − v_i + 1)		...(2)

* We have implemented the following optimisations:

Timing optimisations:
--------------------
a. In both 4-sided and 6-sided boards, when playing first, the first move is (0,0), as playing the corner is considered an optimal strategy by us.
b. Plays forced moves as soon as they are detected, the absence of which would lead to the opponent's victory immediately in the next move.
c. Dynamic number of iterations based on the remaining time
d. The path compression union-find algorithm for the detection of bridges and forks was found to be helpful in the case of the 6-sided board but not the case of the 4-sided board, and it is thus implemented likewise.

Strategic optimisations:
-----------------------
a. Higher weights are placed on virtual connections and neighbours during rollouts.
b. Increased randomisation in the selection phase to ensure propagation of correct information.
c. In a 4-sided board, when playing second, the first move is hardcoded to occupy one of the points where the opponent may have formed a virtual connection.  
d. In a 6-sided board, the first move is hardcoded to occupy corners when playing second.
